orders_prompt = """### Generate Results for a Patient Simulation Case for New Orders

**Task:** Leverage the new orders/actions provided, and the comprehensive patient case information, to generate accurate and consistent results 
for a simulated patient case. Do not comment on results or orders. Your job is to interpret the order silently and provide results that match the case.
If the orders/actions are ambiguous, make a best guess. If wrong, the user will enter another order. Again, just results, no commentary.

Thus, the focus is on returning precise results for just the most recent time stamped *new* orders/actions that align with evolving case details, 
without including extraneous commentary. (You'll see prior orders in the prior results section for context.)

**Input Details:**

- **New Orders/Actions**: {order_details}
- **New Orders Date and Time**: {order_datetime}
- **Case Scenario**: {case_details}
- **Prior Results**: {prior_results}

**Prompt:**

Given the specified orders, alongside the patient context, create a set of results **only for the new specific orders/actions** that:
- Are tailored to the provided patient case, reflecting an understanding of their condition and history.
- Include clear outcomes for each lab test ordered, presented in a markdown table with date and time set to 10 minutes after the order date and time.
- If medications were ordered, include a note on their administration status and any resultant reactions, maintaining consistency with the patient's detailed case. If no medications were ordered, exclude the medication administration section.
- If explicitly requested, provide findings for physical examination (e.g. lung exam) or vitals. Carefully craft the updated findings as expected using the patient’s evolving case.
- If the action requested is unsafe for the patient, state the nurse is refusing to carry out the order on your behalf given patient safety concerns.


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure the results directly tie back to and are consistent with the patient scenario described.
- Use the prior results from earlier orders for context to enhance the accuracy of the evolving case with the new results. 
- Keep the response focused exclusively on providing the requested results for the new orders/actions. Avoid unrelated details or commentary, e.g., "no new medications" or "simulation".
- Aim to enhance the realism of the simulation for students, fostering a deeper understanding of patient care and clinical decision-making processes.
- Make your best match possible for any abbreviations used in Orders/Actions. For example, CMP is comprehensive metabolic panel, BMP is basic metabolic panel, and cbc is complete blood count. Generate all corresponding lab results in the same table. 

**Generate results without commentary about efforts matching the case details.**

**Example User Input:**
- **Specific Orders**: Complete blood count (CBC), chest X-ray, administer 500 mg Acetaminophen
- **Order Date and Time**: 2024-05-24 10:30 AM
- **Case Scenario**: A 45-year-old male patient presenting with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
- **Prior Results**:


**Sample Generated Output:**

**Chest X-ray Findings:**
- Mild bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia.

**Medication Administration:**
- 500 mg Acetaminophen administered at 10:45 AM. No adverse reactions noted.

**Physical Exam Findings:**
- Lung Examination: Bilateral crackles heard in the lower lobes.

Significant laboratory findings included elevated white blood cell count, liver function tests, and particularly a significantly elevated lipase level, which is highly suggestive of pancreatitis.\n\nImaging studies further confirmed the diagnosis by revealing a swollen pancreas with peripancreatic fat stranding but no gallstones, which fits the clinical picture of acute pancreatitis.\n\nManagement typically involves hospitalization for fasting, IV fluid hydration, pain control, and monitoring for complications. Addressing the underlying cause, such as alcohol cessation in this case, is also a critical step in management."
